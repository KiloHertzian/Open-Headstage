# Known Issues & Development Status

This document tracks known bugs, significant limitations, and development blockers for the Open Headstage project. It is intended to be kept updated by human developers and AI assistants working on this codebase.

## Instructions for Keeping This File Updated (For AI/LLM Assistants)

**Objective:** Maintain this file as an accurate, concise summary of critical issues affecting development progress or plugin functionality.

**When to Update:**

*   **New Issues:** If a subtask fails unexpectedly due to a previously unknown code bug, compilation error (beyond the already documented `nih-plug` issue), or a tool/dependency problem, add a new entry.
*   **Newly Identified Limitations:** If analysis reveals a new limitation in the current design or implementation (e.g., a feature not fully working as intended, a performance bottleneck discovered), add an entry.
*   **Status Changes:** When a subtask successfully resolves an issue listed here, update its status (e.g., to "Resolved" or "Mitigated") and briefly note the fix.
*   **Clarifications:** If more information about an existing bug becomes available, update its description.

**Format for Bug/Issue Entries:**

*   **Title/Summary:** A brief, clear description of the issue.
*   **Status:** `[Open]`, `[Resolved]`, `[Mitigated]`, `[Workaround Implemented]`
*   **Details:**
    *   A more detailed explanation of the problem.
    *   If code-related, specify the file(s) and relevant sections if known (e.g., `src/sofa/loader.rs`, `MySofa::get_hrtf_irs()`).
    *   If an environment or toolchain issue, describe it as such.
    *   If applicable, mention any error messages observed.
*   **Impact:** Briefly describe how this issue affects the project (e.g., "blocks compilation", "prevents feature X from working", "degrades performance").
*   **Date Identified:** (Optional, but helpful)
*   **Resolution (if applicable):** Briefly describe how the issue was resolved or mitigated.

**Review Cadence:**

*   Review this file at the beginning of any new major task or if the development direction changes significantly.
*   Before submitting changes, consider if any new issues were uncovered or existing ones resolved that need to be reflected here.

**Goal:** Ensure this file serves as a useful, up-to-date reference for any developer (human or AI) jumping into the project. Keep entries clear, factual, and actionable where possible.

## Current Known Issues / Development Blockers

**ðŸŽ‰ Major Milestone: All compilation blockers have been resolved! The project now compiles and tests pass successfully.**

*Currently no active development blockers. The plugin framework integration is functional and ready for further development.*

## Recently Resolved Issues (June 2025)

### 1. Cargo.toml Example Reference
*   **Status:** `[Resolved]`
*   **Problem:** `cargo test` and other commands failed due to missing `examples/standalone.rs` file referenced in `Cargo.toml`.
*   **Solution:** Removed the `[[example]]` section entirely as it wasn't needed for core functionality.
*   **Impact:** Restored ability to run basic cargo commands.

### 2. NIH-Plug API Method Signatures
*   **Status:** `[Resolved]`
*   **Problem:** Method signature mismatches between implementation and trait definition:
    *   `editor` method used `&self` instead of required `&mut self` (E0053)
    *   `ClapFeature::Spatial` variant doesn't exist in current nih-plug version (E0599)
*   **Solution:**
    *   Updated `editor` method signature to use `&mut self`
    *   Removed invalid `ClapFeature::Spatial` from CLAP features array
*   **Impact:** Eliminated compilation errors, restored plugin trait compatibility.

### 3. Core NIH-Plug Macro Compilation Failures
*   **Status:** `[Resolved]`
*   **Problem:** Deep compilation problems with `nih-plug` procedural macros (`#[derive(Params)]` and `nih_export_clap!`). Original error was `E0277: the trait bound <PluginStruct>: ClapPlugin is not satisfied`.
*   **Solution:** The API compatibility fixes (issues #1 and #2 above) resolved the underlying macro compilation issues. The procedural macros now work correctly with the properly implemented trait methods.
*   **Impact:** **Full plugin compilation now works**. This removes the major development blocker and enables:
    *   Functional parameter definition and host automation
    *   Plugin export and testing in CLAP hosts
    *   UI development with nih-plug-egui
    *   Integration testing of DSP modules within the plugin framework

### 4. SOFA Error Handling
*   **Status:** `[Resolved]`
*   **Problem:** Missing error checking for FFI calls to libmysofa.
*   **Solution:** Added proper return code checking and error propagation for `mysofa_getfilter_float`.
*   **Impact:** Improved robustness and debugging capability for SOFA file operations.

## Development Status Summary

**âœ… Compilation Status:** All modules compile successfully  
**âœ… Testing Status:** All unit tests pass  
**âœ… Framework Integration:** nih-plug macros and traits working correctly  
**âœ… Core DSP:** Convolution engine, parametric EQ, and AutoEQ parser implemented and tested  
**âœ… SOFA Integration:** FFI bindings and error handling implemented

**Next Development Priorities:**
1. Test plugin compilation to CLAP format (`cargo xtask bundle`)
2. Test plugin loading in CLAP hosts (REAPER, Ardour, Bitwig)
3. Implement actual DSP integration in the plugin's `process()` method
4. Develop the UI using nih-plug-egui
5. Add SOFA file loading functionality to the plugin initialization

**Development Velocity:** The project has moved from blocked to actively developable. All major architectural components are in place and functional.
