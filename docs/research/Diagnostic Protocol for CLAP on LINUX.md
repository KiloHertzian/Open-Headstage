Deep Dive Investigation: A Diagnostic Protocol for Undetected CLAP Plugins on Linux


Introduction

A validated CLAP (CLever Audio Plug-in) plugin, correctly structured and placed in standard Linux directories such as ~/.clap or /usr/lib/clap, is expected to be discoverable by compliant host applications. When such a plugin fails to appear in hosts like Reaper or Carla, and the failure is one of silent non-detection rather than a crash during the scan, it points to a subtle breakdown in the complex interaction between the plugin, the host, and the underlying operating system. The official clap-validator tool confirms the plugin's adherence to the API specification, but it cannot account for the myriad environmental and host-specific factors that govern real-world discovery and loading.
This report presents a systematic, multi-layered diagnostic protocol designed to identify the root cause of such silent detection failures. The investigation will proceed from the outside in, beginning with the most fundamental and common sources of error at the operating system levelâ€”filesystem permissions, security policies, and packaging sandboxes. It will then move deeper into the specific caching and scanning behaviors of Reaper and Carla, followed by an analysis of the runtime environment, including dynamic library linking and potential C++ ABI conflicts. Finally, it will scrutinize the plugin bundle and its clap-entry.json manifest for subtle formatting or semantic issues that might cause a host's parser to reject it. This layered approach ensures that common, simple problems are eliminated before progressing to more complex and esoteric possibilities, providing a comprehensive and actionable path to resolution.

Section 1: Filesystem, Permissions, and Environment Integrity

The initial phase of this investigation addresses the most fundamental prerequisite for plugin discovery: the ability of the Digital Audio Workstation (DAW), running as a standard user, to access and read the plugin bundle and all its constituent files. Errors at this foundational level are a frequent cause of silent failures. A DAW's plugin scanner, when confronted with a file or directory it cannot access, often does not generate an explicit "Permission Denied" error visible to the user. Instead, the operating system's denial of access is treated by the scanner as if the file simply does not exist. The scanner then silently proceeds to the next item, leaving the developer to suspect more complex issues within their code. Therefore, an exhaustive verification of filesystem accessibility is the first and most critical diagnostic step.

1.1 Canonical File and Directory Permissions

The user account under which the DAW process is running must possess read (r) access to the .clap directory and all its contents, as well as execute (x) access to all directories in the path and the shared object (.so) file itself. Execute permissions on directories are required to traverse them, and on the .so file to allow the dynamic linker to load it into memory.

User-Local Installation (~/.clap/)

For plugins installed in a user's home directory, the entire bundle must be owned by that user and their primary group. A common pitfall is using sudo to copy or create the bundle, which can result in root ownership, making the files unreadable by the user's applications.1
Diagnostic Command (Ownership): To recursively check the ownership of the plugin bundle, execute:
Bash
ls -lR ~/.clap/open-headstage.clap


Remediation Command (Ownership): If ownership is incorrect, correct it recursively. The $(whoami) command substitution ensures the command works for any user.
Bash
sudo chown -R $(whoami):$(whoami) ~/.clap/open-headstage.clap


Correct Permissions: Directories require 755 permissions (drwxr-xr-x), allowing the owner to read, write, and execute (traverse), and all others to read and execute. Data files like clap-entry.json require 644 (-rw-r--r--), allowing the owner to read/write and others to read. The shared library (.so) file is an executable and thus requires 755 (-rwxr-xr-x).2
Remediation Commands (Permissions): To apply these permissions systematically, use the find command:
Bash
find ~/.clap/open-headstage.clap -type d -exec chmod 755 {} \;
find ~/.clap/open-headstage.clap -type f -name "*.json" -exec chmod 644 {} \;
find ~/.clap/open-headstage.clap -type f -name "*.so" -exec chmod 755 {} \;



System-Wide Installation (/usr/lib/clap/)

For plugins intended to be available to all users on the system, the ownership and permissions model is different. The files must be owned by the root user and group, which is standard for system directories.1
Remediation Command (Ownership):
Bash
sudo chown -R root:root /usr/lib/clap/open-headstage.clap


Correct Permissions: The permissions must be world-readable and world-executable to allow standard user processes to access them. The same 755/644/755 permission scheme as the user-local installation is appropriate.
Remediation Commands (Permissions):
Bash
sudo find /usr/lib/clap/open-headstage.clap -type d -exec chmod 755 {} \;
sudo find /usr/lib/clap/open-headstage.clap -type f -name "*.json" -exec chmod 644 {} \;
sudo find /usr/lib/clap/open-headstage.clap -type f -name "*.so" -exec chmod 755 {} \;

1.2 Symbolic Links: A Potential Point of Failure

Symbolic links are a common and powerful tool on Linux for organizing files without duplicating them.4 Most well-behaved applications traverse them transparently. However, some complex applications, particularly those with custom file I/O routines or security-conscious designs, may be configured not to follow symlinks or may handle them incorrectly.6 While DAWs are generally expected to handle them, it remains a potential point of failure that must be eliminated during diagnostics.
Diagnostic Step: If the open-headstage.clap directory in ~/.clap or /usr/lib/clap is a symbolic link, temporarily replace it with a direct, physical copy of the directory.
Identify the target of the symbolic link:
Bash
LINK_TARGET=$(readlink -f ~/.clap/open-headstage.clap)


Remove the link:
Bash
rm ~/.clap/open-headstage.clap


Copy the actual directory to its place:
Bash
cp -rL "$LINK_TARGET" ~/.clap/

(The -L flag dereferences the source link, ensuring you copy the contents.)
Re-apply the correct ownership and permissions as a sanity check using the commands from Section 1.1.
Analysis: After replacing the link with a physical copy, force a clean rescan in the DAW. If the plugin now appears, the host's handling of symbolic links was the root cause. This could be due to a bug, a security feature, or an interaction with sandboxing technologies.

1.3 Mandatory Access Control (MAC) Systems (SELinux & AppArmor)

Standard Unix permissions are not the only security mechanism on modern Linux systems. Mandatory Access Control (MAC) systems like SELinux and AppArmor provide an additional layer of security that can block file access even when traditional permissions would allow it. These systems operate based on security labels (or "contexts") assigned to processes and files, and enforce a system-wide policy defining which process contexts are allowed to interact with which file contexts. A policy violation results in a silent access denial from the DAW's perspective, making MAC systems a prime suspect for inexplicable detection failures on distributions where they are enabled by default.

Diagnosing SELinux (Fedora, RHEL, CentOS)

SELinux enforces policies based on labels attached to every file and process. A mismatch between the DAW's process label and the plugin file's label can block access.
Check Status: First, determine if SELinux is active and in enforcing mode.
Bash
sestatus

The output will show the "SELinux status" as enabled and the "Current mode" as enforcing, permissive, or disabled.7 If it is enforcing, it is a potential cause.
Check Audit Logs: SELinux logs all policy violations to the audit log. The ausearch utility is the primary tool for querying this log. Search for Access Vector Cache (AVC) denials related to the DAW process or plugin files.
Bash
sudo ausearch -m AVC -ts recent | grep -i -E "reaper|carla|open-headstage"

A denial message will explicitly state the source context (e.g., the reaper process), the target context (the plugin file), and the denied permission (e.g., read).10
Temporary Mitigation (for testing): To confirm SELinux as the cause, temporarily switch it to permissive mode. In this mode, violations are logged but not blocked.
Bash
sudo setenforce 0

After running this command, force a rescan in the DAW. If the plugin is now detected, the SELinux policy is definitively the issue. The permanent solution involves writing a custom policy module or changing the file contexts (chcon) to an appropriate type, which is beyond the scope of this diagnostic but is the correct path forward. Remember to re-enable enforcement after testing with sudo setenforce 1.7

Diagnosing AppArmor (Ubuntu, Debian, SUSE)

AppArmor works by confining applications to a profile that defines which files they are allowed to access. If the DAW is running with a restrictive profile, it may be blocked from accessing the CLAP plugin directories.
Check Status: Use the apparmor_status or aa-status command to view the current state of all profiles.
Bash
sudo apparmor_status

Look for a profile corresponding to the DAW executable (e.g., /usr/bin/reaper) and check if it is in enforce mode.11
Check System Logs: AppArmor denials are logged to the systemd journal or syslog. Tailing the log while the DAW performs a scan is an effective way to see violations in real-time.
Bash
sudo journalctl -f | grep "apparmor=\"DENIED\""

The log entry will detail the profile name, the process ID, the operation (e.g., open), and the name of the file that was denied access.14
Temporary Mitigation (for testing): If a profile exists for the DAW, switch it to complain mode. This mode logs violations but does not enforce them.
Bash
# Example for a Reaper profile
sudo aa-complain /usr/bin/reaper

Force a rescan. If the plugin now appears, the AppArmor profile is the cause and needs to be modified to include a rule allowing access to the CLAP plugin paths.14

1.4 Investigating Extended File Attributes (xattrs)

Extended attributes are a filesystem feature that allows for storing arbitrary metadata as name-value pairs associated with files.16 While typically used for features like ACLs or security labels (which are managed by the tools above), custom attributes could potentially interfere with a DAW's scanner if it is not designed to handle them. This is a less common cause but is worth investigating.
Diagnostic Command: Use the getfattr command to dump all extended attributes for the plugin's files. The -d flag dumps all attributes, and -m '' with an empty pattern ensures no namespaces are excluded.17
Bash
getfattr -d -m '' ~/.clap/open-headstage.clap/x86_64-linux/libopen_headstage.so


Analysis: The output will typically show security.selinux or system.posix_acl_access attributes. If any unusual attributes in the user.* namespace are present, they could be a factor. Use setfattr -x user.attribute_name <file> to remove them for testing purposes.19

1.5 The Flatpak Sandbox Complication: A Common Culprit

On modern Linux desktops, applications are increasingly distributed via sandboxed formats like Flatpak. A Flatpak application runs in a container with a restricted view of the host filesystem. By default, it cannot access arbitrary paths like /usr/lib/clap or the user's real home directory. This sandboxing is a very common reason for plugins to be invisible to a DAW installed as a Flatpak.21
Diagnostic Steps:
Identify if the DAW is a Flatpak:
Bash
flatpak list | grep -i -E "reaper|carla"

If this command returns an entry, the application is a Flatpak.
Inspect Filesystem Permissions: Use flatpak info to see the permissions granted to the application.
Bash
flatpak info --show-permissions app.id.for.reaper # Use the ID from 'flatpak list'

Look at the filesystems entry. If it does not include host (full access) or specific overrides for /usr/lib/clap and ~/.clap, the DAW is sandboxed from your plugins.
Remediation: The recommended tool for managing Flatpak permissions is flatseal, a graphical utility. Install it (sudo apt install flatseal or sudo dnf install flatseal). Launch Flatseal, select your DAW from the list, and in the "Filesystem" section, add /usr/lib/clap and ~/.var/app/app.id.for.reaper/config/clap (or the real ~/.clap if you grant broader home access) to the "Other files" list. After saving the changes, restart the DAW and force a rescan.

Section 2: DAW-Specific Caching and Scanning Forensics

Once filesystem-level access has been thoroughly confirmed, the investigation must turn to the internal behavior of the DAWs themselves. Both Reaper and Carla employ caching to accelerate startup times by avoiding a full rescan of all plugins on every launch. However, this cache can become corrupted or stale, especially during plugin development when files are frequently changed. A definitive, "clean slate" rescan is often required to resolve detection issues.
Table 2: DAW Cache and Log Locations
DAW
Cache File(s) Location
Cache File Name(s)
Clean Rescan Procedure
Log/Output Method
Reaper
~/.config/REAPER/ (or Options -> Show REAPER resource path...)
reaper-vstplugins64.ini, reaper-clapplugins64.ini (or similar)
1. In Reaper: Options -> Preferences -> Plugins -> VST -> Clear cache / Re-scan. 2. Close Reaper. 3. Manually delete the .ini cache file(s). 4. Relaunch Reaper.
Launch from terminal: reaper
Carla
~/.config/falkTX/
Carla-Patchbay.conf, Carla-Rack.conf, etc. (No single cache file; settings are distributed)
1. In Carla: Add Plugin -> Refresh. 2. Close Carla. 3. (Drastic) Manually delete ~/.config/falkTX/Carla* files. 4. Relaunch Carla.
Launch from terminal: carla. Check "Log" tab in UI.


2.1 Reaper: Forcing a Clean Slate

Reaper maintains its plugin cache in human-readable .ini files located within its resource directory. A common failure mode occurs when an entry in this file becomes truncated or corrupted during a scan, causing Reaper to ignore the plugin on subsequent launches.22 While the file names often reference VSTs, the same mechanism applies to all plugin formats, including CLAP.24
Definitive Clean Re-scan Procedure:
Open Reaper. Navigate to the menu Options -> Show REAPER resource path in explorer/finder. This will open a file manager at the correct location (typically ~/.config/REAPER/). Make a note of this path.
In Reaper, navigate to Options -> Preferences -> Plug-ins -> VST.
Click the button labeled Clear cache / Re-scan. This signals Reaper to discard its in-memory cache and perform a new scan.26
Crucially, close Reaper completely. This step is essential to ensure that Reaper writes its (now potentially empty) cache to disk and releases any locks on the cache files.
Using the file manager or terminal, navigate to the resource path from step 1.
Manually delete any files that appear to be plugin caches, such as reaper-vstplugins64.ini, reaper-clapplugins64.ini, and reaper-auplugins64.ini. This ensures that Reaper cannot load any stale data from disk on the next launch.24
Launch Reaper from a terminal to capture all standard output and error messages during the scan process.
Bash
/opt/REAPER/reaper

(Adjust the path to your Reaper installation if necessary.)
Log Analysis: Reaper does not maintain a persistent, dedicated log file for plugin scans.28 The primary and most valuable source of diagnostic information is the live output printed to the terminal when it is launched from the command line.
Search Keywords: Monitor the terminal output for any lines containing relevant keywords. Using grep can help filter the potentially verbose output.
Bash
/opt/REAPER/reaper | grep -i -E "clap|open-headstage|fail|error|cannot load|skipping"

Look for any messages indicating that Reaper found the .clap bundle but failed to parse it, load the shared library, or instantiate the plugin.

2.2 Carla: Unraveling the Scan Process

Carla's configuration, including its list of known plugins and search paths, is stored in various files within the ~/.config/falkTX/ directory.29 Unlike Reaper, it does not use a single, monolithic cache file. A full reset involves removing its entire configuration directory, forcing it to start from a completely fresh state.
Definitive Clean Re-scan Procedure:
Ensure Carla is not running.
(Optional but Recommended) Back up and remove the existing configuration: This is a more forceful step than simply rescanning and can resolve issues caused by corrupted configuration files.
Bash
mkdir -p ~/carla_config_backup
mv ~/.config/falkTX/Carla* ~/carla_config_backup/


Launch Carla from a terminal to monitor its output:
Bash
carla


Once Carla is open, click the Add Plugin button. In the new window, click the Refresh button to initiate a full scan of all configured plugin paths.30
Observe the terminal output for messages generated during the scan.
Log Analysis: Carla provides two primary sources for diagnostic information. The first, like Reaper, is the standard output captured when launching from a terminal.31 The second is the "Log" tab within the Carla user interface, which displays messages from the Carla backend and can reveal internal errors that might not be printed to the console.32
Search Keywords: In the terminal output and the Log tab, look for messages containing clap, open-headstage, fail, error, cannot open, or could not load.

2.3 Known Bugs and Implementation Idiosyncrasies

Plugin standards are subject to interpretation, and hosts may contain bugs or unique behaviors that affect plugin compatibility.
Reaper:
There are documented cases of specific JUCE-based CLAP plugins causing segmentation faults in Reaper when being removed from a track.33 While this is a crash rather than a discovery failure, it points to the complexity of the host-plugin interaction and the potential for bugs in Reaper's CLAP implementation.
Certain U-he CLAP plugins have been observed to alter the host's state upon project load, creating an immediate entry in the undo history.34 This suggests that the way Reaper queries or initializes plugin state might have quirks that could, in some edge cases, lead to a silent failure during the initial scan if the plugin's state descriptor is misinterpreted.
Carla:
A significant bug was present in Carla version 2.4.2 (as shipped in Ubuntu 22.04) where the plugin "Refresh" button would fail to trigger a scan, producing a Python TypeError.35 If using an older distribution, it is critical to verify the Carla version and upgrade if necessary, potentially by using a third-party repository like KXStudio, which often provides more up-to-date audio software.35
CLAP support in Carla is a more recent development compared to its long-standing support for formats like LV2 and VST2.37 As such, its implementation may be less mature. It is imperative to be running the latest available version of Carla to benefit from recent bug fixes and improvements.

Section 3: Dynamic Linking and Runtime Dependencies

If the investigation confirms that the DAW has appropriate filesystem access and that its cache is not the issue, the next logical point of failure is the dynamic linking stage. This is when the host's scanner, having found the plugin's .so file, attempts to load it into the process's address space using the system's dynamic linker (via a dlopen() call). A failure here is often silent from the user's perspective but is typically caused by one of two issues: the plugin's shared library has an unmet dependency, or the runtime environment of the host conflicts with the build environment of the plugin.
A plugin does not operate in isolation; it inherits the process environment of its host. This includes environment variables, already-loaded libraries, and the specific C++ runtime in use. The clap-validator tool, running in its own pristine environment, may successfully load the plugin, while the same plugin fails inside a DAW that has a more complex and potentially conflicting runtime environment. Therefore, it is insufficient to validate a plugin's dependencies in a vacuum; they must be analyzed from within the context of the host's process.

3.1 Unmasking Hidden Dependencies with ldd

The ldd (List Dynamic Dependencies) utility is an indispensable tool for inspecting an executable or shared library. It reports which shared libraries the object depends on and which files on the system the dynamic linker resolves those dependencies to.40
Diagnostic Command: Execute ldd against your plugin's .so file.
Bash
ldd ~/.clap/open-headstage.clap/x86_64-linux/libopen_headstage.so


Interpreting the Output: The output lists each required library and the path to the file that satisfies the requirement.
Success: A line like libcurl.so.4 => /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libcurl.so.4 (0x...) indicates that the dependency libcurl.so.4 was successfully found.
Critical Failure: A line that reads libcustomdependency.so.1 => not found is a definitive error. It means the dynamic linker could not locate a library that your plugin requires to function. The dlopen() call from the DAW will fail, and the plugin will not be loaded. The solution is to identify which package provides the missing library file and install it.
Note on linux-vdso.so.1: This is a virtual dynamic shared object provided by the kernel to optimize certain system calls. It is not a file on disk and its presence in the ldd output is normal and can be disregarded.

3.2 The LD_LIBRARY_PATH Trap: Diagnosing Library Conflicts

LD_LIBRARY_PATH is an environment variable that provides a list of directories for the dynamic linker to search for shared libraries before it searches the standard system locations. While useful for temporary testing, setting it globally is strongly discouraged because it can hijack the linking process, forcing applications to load incompatible or unintended library versions, leading to instability and crashes.43 Some DAWs, particularly proprietary ones, may be launched via a wrapper script that sets this variable to ensure their own bundled libraries are used. This can create a conflict with your plugin's dependencies.
Diagnostic Steps:
Check the Current Shell Environment: First, check if the variable is set in the terminal session from which you are launching the DAW.
Bash
echo $LD_LIBRARY_PATH

If this command outputs a path, it is a potential source of conflict. As a test, unset the variable and launch the DAW from the same terminal.
Bash
unset LD_LIBRARY_PATH
reaper

If the plugin now loads, the global LD_LIBRARY_PATH was the culprit.
Inspect the DAW's Live Environment: A DAW might set the variable internally, or be launched by a script that sets it. To see the exact environment of the running DAW process, you can inspect the /proc filesystem.
First, get the Process ID (PID) of the running DAW:
Bash
pgrep -a reaper


Then, inspect the environment file for that PID (e.g., for PID 12345):
Bash
cat /proc/12345/environ | tr '\0' '\n' | grep LD_LIBRARY_PATH

The tr command replaces null characters with newlines to make the output readable. If this command reveals that LD_LIBRARY_PATH is set for the running process, it confirms that the DAW's environment is modified, which could be causing a library conflict with your plugin.

3.3 Diagnosing C++ ABI Incompatibilities (libstdc++ vs. libc++)

A subtle but critical source of loading failures is C++ Application Binary Interface (ABI) incompatibility. The C++ standard defines the source code language but not the binary layout of objects, virtual tables, name mangling, or exception handling. On Linux, the two dominant C++ standard library implementations are GCC's libstdc++ and Clang's libc++. These two libraries are not ABI-compatible.46
If a plugin is compiled and linked against libc++ but the host DAW is linked against libstdc++, any attempt to pass C++ objects (like std::string or std::vector) across the plugin boundary, or even the initial construction of the plugin's main C++ object, can fail. This failure often occurs deep within the dlopen() call and results in the plugin simply not loading, with no clear error message.
Diagnostic Steps:
Identify the C++ Library Linked by Your Plugin: Use ldd to see which standard C++ library your .so file depends on.
Bash
ldd ~/.clap/open-headstage.clap/x86_64-linux/libopen_headstage.so | grep -E "libstdc\+\+|libc\+\+"


Identify the C++ Library Linked by the DAW: Perform the same check on the main executable of the DAW.
Bash
# For Reaper, assuming it's in the PATH
ldd $(which reaper) | grep -E "libstdc\+\+|libc\+\+"

# For Carla, you may need to find its backend binary
ldd /usr/lib/carla/carla-backend-native | grep -E "libstdc\+\+|libc\+\+"


Analyze the Results: Compare the output from both commands. If your plugin shows a dependency on libc++.so.1 and the DAW shows a dependency on libstdc++.so.6, you have an ABI incompatibility. The only reliable solution is to recompile your plugin to use the same C++ standard library as the host. For broad compatibility across the Linux ecosystem, targeting the system's default GCC toolchain and libstdc++ is generally the most robust strategy.

Section 4: In-depth clap-entry.json and Bundle Integrity Analysis

After exhausting all system-level and runtime environment diagnostics, the final area of investigation is the plugin bundle itself, with a particular focus on its manifest file, clap-entry.json. A syntactically or semantically invalid manifest can cause a host's parser to silently reject the plugin before it ever attempts to load the shared library.
The official CLAP specification does not provide a formal schema (like a JSON Schema) for clap-entry.json.47 Its structure is implicitly defined by the C header files, particularly the
clap_plugin_descriptor_t struct found in clap/plugin.h 49, and by the behavior of reference implementations like the
clap-info tool.50 This means that for a manifest to be considered valid, it must not only be well-formed JSON but must also contain the correct keys and data types that map directly to the fields of the C descriptor struct.

4.1 Beyond Syntax: Semantic and Formatting Requirements

JSON Syntactic Validity: The first and most basic check is to ensure the file is syntactically correct JSON. Common errors include trailing commas, mismatched brackets, or improper string quoting. A command-line tool like jq can instantly validate the syntax.
Bash
jq. ~/.clap/open-headstage.clap/clap-entry.json

If this command produces an error, the JSON is malformed and must be corrected. If it successfully pretty-prints the JSON, the syntax is valid.
File Encoding: The clap-entry.json file must be encoded as UTF-8. Crucially, it should not contain a Byte Order Mark (BOM) at the beginning of the file. A BOM is a special character sequence that can be invisible in some text editors but will cause many simple JSON parsers to fail.
Line Endings: While most modern parsers can handle both Unix-style (\n) and Windows-style (\r\n) line endings, it is best practice on Linux to use Unix-style line endings to eliminate any potential parsing ambiguity.

4.2 Field-Specific Constraints and Best Practices

Based on the C headers and example plugins, the clap-entry.json file should contain a root object with a single key, "clap.plugins". The value of this key must be an array of objects, where each object represents a single plugin descriptor.
Example Structure:
JSON
{
  "clap.plugins": [
    {
      "clap_version": "1.2.0",
      "id": "com.my-company.open-headstage",
      "name": "Open Headstage",
      "vendor": "My Company",
      "version": "1.0.0",
      "description": "A brief description of the plugin.",
      "features": [
        "audio_effect",
        "stereo"
      ]
    }
  ]
}


id field: This is the most critical field for host identification. It must be a globally unique string for your plugin. The strong convention, as seen in the official plugin template 49, is to use a reverse-DNS format (e.g.,
com.your-company.your-plugin). This format avoids collisions and is widely used across software development. The ID should not contain spaces or special characters that might be problematic for parsers or filesystem storage.
name, vendor, description: These are user-facing strings. While they can contain Unicode characters, for initial debugging it is wise to stick to simple ASCII characters to rule out any encoding-related parsing issues in the host.
clap_version: This string must correspond to the version of the CLAP API headers the plugin was compiled against (e.g., "1.2.0").
features: This is an array of strings that describe the plugin's capabilities. These strings must match the feature identifiers defined in the CLAP specification (e.g., "audio_effect", "instrument", "stereo", "mono"). An incorrect or unrecognized feature string could cause a host to categorize the plugin incorrectly or reject it.

4.3 Validating Bundle Structure and Case Sensitivity

The .clap bundle is a directory with a specific internal layout. On Linux, which uses case-sensitive filesystems, the naming of files and directories must be exact.
Directory Structure: The specified structure is correct and must be strictly followed.
open-headstage.clap/
â”œâ”€â”€ clap-entry.json
â””â”€â”€ x86_64-linux/
    â””â”€â”€ libopen_headstage.so


Case Sensitivity: A common and easy-to-miss error is incorrect casing. Verify that the filenames are exactly clap-entry.json (all lowercase) and x86_64-linux. Any deviation, such as Clap-Entry.json or X86_64-Linux, will cause compliant hosts to fail to find the required files within the bundle.

Conclusion: A Systematic Diagnostic Checklist

To resolve the issue of a validated CLAP plugin not being detected by Reaper or Carla on Linux, a systematic approach is required. The following checklist summarizes the diagnostic protocol detailed in this report. The steps are ordered from the most probable and easily verifiable causes to the more complex and esoteric issues. Executing these steps sequentially provides the most efficient path to identifying and resolving the problem.
Check for Sandboxing (Most Likely Cause on Modern Desktops):
Determine if Reaper and/or Carla were installed as a Flatpak using the command flatpak list.
If so, use the flatseal utility to grant the application explicit filesystem access to the standard CLAP paths: ~/.clap and /usr/lib/clap.
Verify Ownership and Permissions:
Execute ls -lR on the .clap bundle in its installation directory.
For user-local installs (~/.clap), ensure ownership is your_user:your_group. For system-wide installs (/usr/lib/clap), ensure ownership is root:root.
Use the chown and chmod commands to enforce the canonical permissions: 755 for directories and .so files, 644 for .json files.
Force a Complete, Clean Rescan:
Follow the definitive clean re-scan procedure for both Reaper and Carla, which includes manually deleting their respective cache and configuration files (reaper-clapplugins64.ini, ~/.config/falkTX/Carla*) after closing the application.
Monitor Logs by Running from Terminal:
Launch the DAW directly from a terminal window.
Observe the standard output during the startup and plugin scan process. Use grep to filter for keywords such as clap, the plugin's name, error, fail, or cannot load.
Check for Missing Dynamic Libraries:
Run ldd on the plugin's .so file.
If any library is reported as "not found", identify the system package that provides it and install it.
Investigate Environment Contamination:
Check if the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable is set in your shell (echo $LD_LIBRARY_PATH).
Inspect the running DAW's environment via /proc/<PID>/environ to see if the variable is being set by a launcher script. If it is set, try unsetting it as a test.
Check for Mandatory Access Control (MAC) System Blocks:
On Fedora/RHEL, check SELinux status with sestatus and search audit logs with sudo ausearch -m AVC -ts recent.
On Ubuntu/Debian, check AppArmor status with sudo apparmor_status and search system logs with sudo journalctl -f | grep "DENIED".
Temporarily set the system to permissive or complain mode to confirm if a MAC policy is the cause.
Eliminate Symbolic Links as a Variable:
If the .clap bundle is installed via a symbolic link, temporarily replace the link with a physical copy of the directory to rule out issues with the host's ability to traverse symlinks.
Investigate C++ ABI Mismatch:
Use ldd on both the plugin's .so file and the DAW's main executable.
Compare the linked C++ standard library (libstdc++.so.6 vs. libc++.so.1). A mismatch indicates an ABI incompatibility that requires recompiling the plugin.
Scrutinize clap-entry.json and Bundle Integrity:
Validate the JSON syntax using jq. <file>.
Ensure the file is UTF-8 encoded and does not contain a Byte Order Mark (BOM).
Verify that the bundle's directory and file names use the correct, case-sensitive naming conventions (e.g., clap-entry.json, x86_64-linux).
Confirm that the structure and field names within the JSON file (e.g., id, clap_version, features) align with the conventions established by the CLAP C headers and reference tools.
