title: "SOFA: Implement logic to select/extract 4 HRIRs based on angle parameters"
---

Develop logic to select the nearest available HRTF measurement from the loaded SOFA data based on user-provided azimuth/elevation angles. Extract the four required HRIRs (LSL, LSR, RSL, RSR) and prepare them in the format needed by the convolution engine (e.g., a 4-channel interleaved buffer or separate buffers).
